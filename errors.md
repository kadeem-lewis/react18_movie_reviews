- when using .map function, the rendered content should have a key. MovieList maps are missing keys
- Nav.Link from bootstrap renders an A tag and the login/logout route was trying to render an a tag inside of an a tag which is not allowed
- the login/logout route also attempts to render a a tag without an href but this only results in a warning and not an error
